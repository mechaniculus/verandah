<p>Chef Sunil's Tasting Menu Table is now available Sundays through Wednesdays by reservation for groups who want to explore 5-9 course meals of specially-created dishes designed by request.</p>

<p>To reserve the Chef's Tasting Menu Table, call <a href="tel:+12815010258" class="telephone">(281) 501 0258</a> or  &nbsp;<a class="telephone" href="tel:+18328864291">(832) 886 4291</a> at least one day in advance and decide on what kind of menu is desired.
